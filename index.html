                                How do you capture what a journey felt like?  Can you capture the narrative arc of a trip in both anecdotal memories and geographic data?  This is a map of the physical realities of a trip, and it is intended to explore how our perceptions and the stories we tell relate to the landscape and weather through which we travel.  Travelling is, after all, a sensory experience.

                                If I could plan a bike race anywhere in the world, New Zealand would be my first choice.  The variety of terrain and ecosystems, the remoteness, and the view make New Zealand one of the best countries in the world to cycle in.  While perhaps not commercially viable, planning and mapping this race was a joyful practice in terrain visualization and sadism.

                                I love when a map immediately gets me excited to <em>go</em> somewhere.  When I am lucky enough to face a long and unknown journey, it is the great emptiness inbetween places on maps and the possibilities of connecting my front door to some distant destination that drives me forward.  While I do not recommend this map for navigational reference, I do recommend it as imaginative fodder.

                                I spent several formative years doing cartography, graphic design, and web development for bicycle share systems around the country, including Boston, New York, Chicago, Chattanooga, and Columbus.  My responsibilities ranged from designing instructional grpahics for the field to collaborating with city governments to shape the visual hierarchy of system maps to be displayed at stations.  Of personal pride is the ever-growing Hubway system which I helped launch in Boston, Massachusetts, and continues to grow yearly.

        <h2>Where I'm Coming From</h2>
        <p>My career and life goals orbit around this creed: to travel is to grow.  I endeavor to get outside and explore every day.  I have always walked, biked, run, or taken some form of public transportation to move between home, work, and community events, and I want to get as many people as possible to do the same.  I am drawn to design thinking to enable and reward people for getting outside.  I aspire to understand how people move through spaces and why, and how these choices affect other aspects of their lives.  I see potential in the communal spatial data being collected around the world, and I want the tools to be able to manipulate this data.  I want to use geospatial technology to encourage a culture of travel that is better for the environment and ourselves.</p>
